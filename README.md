# What is this so far?

My friends really want a PS5. But they're out of stock everywhere! So I took matters into my own hands.

Solution: two scripts (Best Buy and Gamestop) that check the PS5 product page for availability. They add it to cart and wait for you to checkout.

Up next: Broadway ticket lottery!
